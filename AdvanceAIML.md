WHAT IS AI

---

### ✅ **Short Definition (clean, simple, better):**

**Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of a machine to think and learn like a human.**

---

### ✅ **Long Definition (simple, easy, complete):**

**Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that creates machines and software that can think, learn, make decisions, and solve problems like a human being.**
It allows computers to do tasks such as understanding language, recognizing images, learning from data, and even playing games — all without being told every step.

PROBLEMATIC OF AI


## ✅ **What is the First Problematic (Main Problem) of Artificial Intelligence?**

### 🎯 The main question at the beginning of AI was:

> **“Can a machine think like a human?”**

This is the **first and biggest problem** AI tries to solve.

AI wants to find out:

* How can a machine **learn**?
* How can it **solve problems**?
* How can it **make decisions**?
* How can it **understand** like a human?

## 🕰️ **Historical Date – The Beginning of AI**

### 📅 **1950 – Alan Turing**

Alan Turing, a British mathematician, asked a very famous question:

> **“Can machines think?”**

He also created the **Turing Test** — a way to check if a machine can **act like a human** in conversation.
👉 This was the **start of Artificial Intelligence** as an idea.

---

## 🧠 In Simple Words:

The **first problem of AI** is:

> **To make machines that can think and learn like humans.**

That’s why AI was created — to solve problems using **intelligent behavior**, not just fixed instructions.

AI TECHNIQUE


> An **AI technique** is the **intermediate** (the middle part) that helps the **machine learn from data**.

## 🔄 How AI Works (in simple steps):

1. ✅ **We have data**
   👉 Examples: photos, texts, numbers, etc.

2. ✅ **We have a machine**
   👉 A computer or robot that wants to learn or solve a task.

3. ⚙️ **We use an AI technique**
   👉 This is the **“bridge” or method** between the data and the machine.

---

### 🧠 So yes, you are right:

> An **AI technique** is the **intermediate** (the middle part) that helps the **machine learn from data**.

---

### 🔁 Example:

* **Data**: 1000 pictures of cats 🐱
* **Machine**: Your computer 🤖
* **AI Technique**: Machine Learning 🧠
  👉 The technique helps the machine learn to **recognize a cat** in new pictures.
