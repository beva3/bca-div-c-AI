WHAT IS AI

---

### ✅ **Short Definition (clean, simple, better):**

**Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of a machine to think and learn like a human.**

---

### ✅ **Long Definition (simple, easy, complete):**

**Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that creates machines and software that can think, learn, make decisions, and solve problems like a human being.**
It allows computers to do tasks such as understanding language, recognizing images, learning from data, and even playing games — all without being told every step.

PROBLEMATIC OF AI


## ✅ **What is the First Problematic (Main Problem) of Artificial Intelligence?**

### 🎯 The main question at the beginning of AI was:

> **“Can a machine think like a human?”**

This is the **first and biggest problem** AI tries to solve.

AI wants to find out:

* How can a machine **learn**?
* How can it **solve problems**?
* How can it **make decisions**?
* How can it **understand** like a human?

## 🕰️ **Historical Date – The Beginning of AI**

### 📅 **1950 – Alan Turing**

Alan Turing, a British mathematician, asked a very famous question:

> **“Can machines think?”**

He also created the **Turing Test** — a way to check if a machine can **act like a human** in conversation.
👉 This was the **start of Artificial Intelligence** as an idea.

## 🧠 In Simple Words:

The **first problem of AI** is:

> **To make machines that can think and learn like humans.**

That’s why AI was created — to solve problems using **intelligent behavior**, not just fixed instructions.
